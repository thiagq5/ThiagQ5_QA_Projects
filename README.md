# 🚀 Thiago Quinto Souza - QA Automation Portfolio 🚀

Welcome to my personal portfolio of Quality Assurance Automation projects!

## ✨ About Me

As a QA Engineer with over 15 years of solid business experience as a founder and entrepreneur, I bring a unique blend of strategic thinking, problem-solving, and a "business-first" mindset to software quality. My journey into QA began over a year ago as a self-taught professional, building hands-on projects and continuously learning. I am now in a focused sprint to formalize and deepen my expertise in modern automation frameworks.

## 🎯 Current Focus & Goals

My primary objective is to build a robust and practical portfolio demonstrating my skills in:

-   **Web Automation:** Using Cypress.io for End-to-End (E2E) testing.
-   **API Testing:** Leveraging Postman and JavaScript for API validation.
-   **Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD):** Integrating automated tests into development pipelines.

I am dedicated to finding an entry-level QA position (Graduate, Intern, or Part-Time) in Ireland that offers sponsorship for the Critical Skills Employment Permit, where I can contribute my diverse experience and technical skills to a long-term career.
